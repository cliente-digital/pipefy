# Cliente Digital - Pipefy FAQ

1. **what's my organization schema?**

    You can Have a markdown report about your organization schema using the pipefy composer scripts.

```bash
composer pipefy:report schema
```
This scripts output a markdown report of your schema and you can save it to a file 
```bash
composer pipefy:report schema > myschema.md
```
After that you can use this file to create a pdf version using you preferend tool. I use pandoc here as example
```bash
pandoc myschema.md -o myschema.pdf
```


2. **How can I know the id of this [pipe,phase,card, field]?**

Check the report for the Orgs, Pipes, Phases and fields id and if you need the cards id you
can use the Pipefy\Cards to retrieve it.
```php
require __DIR__ . "/../autoload.php";

$cards = (new Clientedigital\Pipefy\Cards($pipeid));
foreach($cards as $card){
    echo $card->id.PHP_EOL;
}
```

3. **How can I search for [card, field, phase]?**


4. **Can I search cards by this field value?**
5. **How can I update this field value?**
6. **How can I move this card between phases?**
7. **what are the limits for using the Pipefy GraphiQL API?**
- number of subsequent queries allowed per time unit: our rate limit is 500 requests for each 30 seconds;
- number of webhooks allowed: the number of webhooks is based in the process size and it depends on the organization subscription as well. Weâ€™d recommend to not have more than 30 webhooks for each pipe, but it is customizable. 
- size of inputs/outputs: the inputs and outputs are based mainly in your process size, using the pre-built queries and mutations. But in a response payload, for example, each request only returns 50 records, requiring then using pagination. 
- size of attachment files: limit of 512MB for each file.
